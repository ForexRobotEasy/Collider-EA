## Description

The Collider EA Trading Robot is a fully automated trading system designed to execute trades based on a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy. The robot identifies buy and sell signals by comparing the current market price with the SMA value. When a buy signal is detected, a buy order is placed with a predefined lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels. Similarly, when a sell signal is detected, a sell order is placed with the same parameters.
